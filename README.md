# Hello World

I’m Daniel Ye 👋, a data analyst with a CPA and a passion for web development 👨‍💻.

I'm currently building several full-stack applications using technologies such as NextJS, Remix, and MobX. When I'm not self-studying or building side-projects, you can find me on the basketball court, rolling around in the BJJ gym, or getting lost in my latest YouTube rabbit-hole obsession. Let’s build something epic!
