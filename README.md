# Hello World

Hi, I'm Daniel Ye!

I'm a data analyst with a passion for transforming complex datasets into actionable insights that drive business decisions. Currently, as a Senior Data Analyst at a leading fleet management company, I specialize in automating data workflows, improving reporting processes, and delivering impactful insights to key stakeholders.

With experience spanning data analysis, software development, and consulting at firms like Deloitte, American Express, and Bank of Montreal, I bring a technical and analytical edge to problem-solving. My CPA designation complements this skill set by adding a deep understanding of business operations and financial analysis.

When I’m not analyzing data, you can find me exploring side projects, hooping on the basketball court 🏀, rolling in the BJJ gym 🤼, or going for a long run 🏃‍♂️💨.
