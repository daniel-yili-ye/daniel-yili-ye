# Hello World

Iâ€™m Daniel Ye ðŸ‘‹, a data analyst with a CPA and a passion for all things data and programming. I'm currently teaching myself data engineering, web development, and dev-ops. When I'm not self-studying or building side-projects, you can find me on the basketball court, lost in a good book, or going for a long run. Letâ€™s build something epic!
